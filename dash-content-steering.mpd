As Apple implemented the spec before DASH ... 

So a dash steering server reponse looks like This

{
"VERSION": 1,
"TTL": 30,
"RELOAD-URI": "https://steering-server.com/steer",
"PATHWAY-PRIORITY": ["CDN1", "CDN2", "CDN3", "CDN4"]
}

 (there is currently on version 1)
 TTL - how long before you should revalidate
 RELOAD-URI - optional - could point to a different steering server on next request

Additional Params on the steering server requests

/ContentSteering?_DASH_pathway=alpha&_DASH_throughput=84267048
/ContentSteering?_DASH_pathway=beta&_DASH_throughput=131642064
/ContentSteering?_DASH_pathway=alpha&_DASH_throughput=131642064

# These are added by the player to indicate the current pathway being used 
# and the current throughput that is being delivered to the player

There are HLS equivalents of these ... the use of DASH_ indicates to the steering server this is
a DASH player that is making the request
this implies we could use the same sttering server for both HLS and DASH
